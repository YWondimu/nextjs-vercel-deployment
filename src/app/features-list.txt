-- mvp --
floors
structure is map of arrays of maps? or array of arrays?
--> order can be based on a "buttonOrder" array
add with add buttons -- they should stand out
add to array
show with show buttons
persistence through text files
scale to same size?
touch should hide or show -- maybe all rooms should have a little circle to indicate that a room is showable? then a floating button allows user to show all rooms or just some? or they show based on the algo
    -- eventually algo should be based on room size, room shows if the room size is large enough (james idea, makes sense)
maybe show based on proximity and zoom?

-- nice to add --
- admin login password - hash lol
